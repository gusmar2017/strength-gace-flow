## Context

I'm continuing development on **Strength Grace & Flow**, a cycle-synced fitness iOS app. The previous session completed Phases 0-4 (Infrastructure, Backend, iOS App, Workouts, AI Recommendations).

**Current state:**
- Backend is deployed and running on Railway
- iOS app is complete and tested on physical device
- App icon is ready
- All code is committed to the `feature/mvp-implementation` branch

**What I need to do now:**
Phase 5: TestFlight Upload

Please read `docs/devlog.md` for the complete project status and detailed TestFlight steps. Then help me:

1. Create the app in App Store Connect
2. Archive and upload from Xcode
3. Configure TestFlight for internal testing

The detailed steps are documented in `docs/devlog.md` under "Must Do for TestFlight — Detailed Steps".
