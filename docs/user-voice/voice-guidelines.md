# Strength, Grace and Flow - Voice & Tone Guidelines

## Brand Voice

Our voice is like a **wise friend** - someone who understands, supports without judgment, and offers gentle guidance. We speak with calm confidence, honoring the wisdom of the body's natural rhythms.

### Voice Pillars

**Strength** - Empowering, confident, supportive
**Grace** - Gentle, elegant, respectful
**Flow** - Natural, rhythmic, harmonious

## Tone Characteristics

### What We Are
- **Gentle** - soft, warm, caring
- **Reflective** - thoughtful, mindful, present
- **Natural** - organic language, not clinical
- **Wise** - knowledgeable without being preachy
- **Minimal** - clear and concise, not over-explaining
- **Neutral** - inclusive of all life stages and goals

### What We're Not
- Clinical or medical-sounding
- Overly cheerful or enthusiastic
- Cutesy or using slang
- Assumptive about reproductive goals
- Anxious or fear-based
- Rushed or transactional

## Language Framework

### Natural Language Preferences
- ✅ **Use**: period, cycle, flow, rhythm
- ❌ **Avoid**: menstruation (too clinical), "that time of month" (too coy)

### Core Vocabulary
Words that align with our brand and feel right for our users:
- **balance**
- **harmony**
- **rhythm**
- **alignment**
- **flow**
- **cycle**
- **energy**
- **patterns**
- **awareness**
- **wisdom**

### Universal & Inclusive Terms
Language that works for everyone, regardless of their reproductive goals:
- "Your cycle" (not "fertility window" unless in fertility-specific context)
- "Energy levels" (neutral, universally relevant)
- "Your body's rhythm" (inclusive, empowering)
- "Day 1" or "start of your cycle" (clear, neutral)

## Writing Style

### Questions vs. Statements
Use a **mix depending on context**:

**Gentle Questions** - For check-ins and reflections:
- "How are you feeling today?"
- "Notice any shifts in your energy?"

**Calm Statements** - For information and guidance:
- "You're in your follicular phase"
- "Day 1 of your cycle"
- "Your energy may feel more expansive today"

**Invitations** - For actions:
- "Take a moment to log how you're feeling"
- "Reflect on your energy today"

### Sentence Structure
- **Short and clear** - avoid run-on sentences
- **Present and grounded** - use present tense
- **Active voice** - you, your, this
- **Minimal punctuation** - periods over exclamation points

### Examples

#### ❌ Before (Too Clinical)
"Did your menstrual period begin today?"

#### ✅ After (Gentle & Natural)
"Is today day 1 of your cycle?"

or even softer:

"Your cycle has begun"

---

#### ❌ Before (Too Medical)
"Track your basal body temperature for ovulation detection"

#### ✅ After (Natural & Purposeful)
"Notice your body's temperature rhythm"

---

#### ❌ Before (Assumptive)
"You're in your fertile window - time to conceive!"

#### ✅ After (Neutral & Informative)
"You're in your mid-cycle phase"

or if in a fertility context:

"Your body is in its most fertile phase"

---

## Context-Specific Guidance

### Onboarding & Education
- Keep explanations minimal and grounded
- Focus on awareness over optimization
- "Your cycle has four phases, each with its own energy"
- NOT: "Maximize your productivity by tracking your cycle!"

### Daily Check-ins
- Gentle, present-moment language
- "How's your energy today?"
- "Notice any changes?"

### Data & Insights
- Reflective, observational tone
- "You tend to feel more energized during this phase"
- NOT: "Studies show you should feel X during this time"

### Errors & Empty States
- Supportive, never scolding
- "When you're ready, log your first entry"
- NOT: "No data yet - start tracking!"

### Notifications
- Soft reminders, never demanding
- "Time for your evening reflection"
- "Your cycle may begin in the next few days"

## Testing Your Copy

Before finalizing any user-facing text, ask:

1. **Does this sound like a wise friend?** (not a doctor, not a app)
2. **Is it gentle and reflective?** (not rushed or clinical)
3. **Does it work for all users?** (regardless of age or reproductive goals)
4. **Does it use our core vocabulary?** (balance, rhythm, harmony, alignment)
5. **Is it minimal?** (could we say it in fewer words?)

If the answer to any is "no," revise.
